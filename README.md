3rd year project- Random Forest Method on Predicting Physical Properties (i.e Temperature, Mass, Luminosity, Classification) of Star Forming Regions

HiGAL-clump-catalogue created by Elia is installed as an original data to reproduce the new data

random forest regression and classification is performed by applying dataset with different features
(flux density withdifferent wavelengths) and targets(mass, temperature and steller classification) in order to
check the correlation between data from catalogue and predicted data from algorithm
